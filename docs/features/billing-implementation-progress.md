# Billing System — Implementation Progress

## Last Update

All billing phases are complete and verified:

Test results:

- webhook/route.test.ts — 12/12 passing ✅
- pnpm lint && pnpm typecheck — clean ✅

The 6 remaining test failures are all pre-existing non-billing issues (BullMQ processor mock, AI quota limit mismatch, live X API call, image route 403 vs 402). None are regressions from the billing work

---

All phases 0–4 are complete. There is no next billing phase in the prompt. The remaining work before billing goes live in production is all manual Stripe configuration (no code changes needed):

1. Register the webhook endpoint in Stripe Dashboard → https://[your-domain]/api/billing/webhook with the 8 events listed in the progress doc
2. Copy the webhook signing secret to STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET in your env
3. Configure Stripe Customer Portal to cancel at period end (not immediately), allow plan switching, and allow updating payment method

## Status: ✅ All Phases Complete (2026-03-26)

## Phase 0 — Audit

- **Status:** ✅ Complete (2026-03-25)
- **Audit Report:** [docs/features/billing-audit-report.md](./billing-audit-report.md)

### Key Findings

#### Blockers (must resolve before billing works)

- **B1** — No AstraPost Stripe products/prices exist. `STRIPE_PRICE_ID_*` env vars unset → checkout falls back to mock IDs.
- **B2** — No Stripe webhook endpoint registered → DB never updated post-checkout.
- **B3** — `checkout/route.ts` uses `customer_email` not `customer` → duplicate Stripe customers on repeat checkouts.
- **B4** — No `subscription_data.trial_period_days` in checkout → Stripe-level trial never offered.

#### Critical Code Issues

- Webhook handlers do multi-table writes without `db.transaction()` (violates CLAUDE.md §15).
- No `src/lib/stripe.ts` singleton — checkout and portal each create `new Stripe()`.
- All Stripe env vars are `.optional()` in `env.ts` — no startup validation.

#### Frontend Gaps

- Settings page shows no subscription lifecycle details (trial end date, next billing date, cancelAtPeriodEnd, past_due warning).
- `/api/billing/usage` returns usage stats only — no subscription status data.
- No post-checkout success polling for webhook race condition.

## Pre-Phase: Stripe Setup

- **Status:** ✅ Complete (2026-03-25)
- **Products & prices created via Stripe MCP:**

| Plan           | Product ID            | Price ID                         | Amount  |
| -------------- | --------------------- | -------------------------------- | ------- |
| Pro Monthly    | `prod_UDLVJC0QQ35iMC` | `price_1TEuoeKrX43F2j4ct5nW7sYS` | $29/mo  |
| Pro Annual     | `prod_UDLV9HcYRBM36k` | `price_1TEuofKrX43F2j4cFp5s90Ou` | $290/yr |
| Agency Monthly | `prod_UDLVHs1ePIlrG5` | `price_1TEuogKrX43F2j4cWO9wNsg1` | $99/mo  |
| Agency Annual  | `prod_UDLVSCcSpjBaNo` | `price_1TEuogKrX43F2j4canS9WCBi` | $990/yr |

- **Env vars updated in `.env`:** All 4 `STRIPE_PRICE_ID_*` vars set.
- **Pending (manual):**
  - [ ] Register webhook endpoint in Stripe dashboard: `https://[domain]/api/billing/webhook`
    - Events: `checkout.session.completed`, `checkout.session.expired`, `customer.subscription.created`, `customer.subscription.updated`, `customer.subscription.deleted`, `customer.subscription.trial_will_end`, `invoice.payment_succeeded`, `invoice.payment_failed`
  - [ ] Copy webhook signing secret to `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` in env
  - [ ] Configure Stripe Customer Portal: allow cancel, switch plan, update payment method, view invoices

## Phase 1 — Core Stripe Integration (Backend)

- **Status:** ✅ Complete (2026-03-25)
- **Files Created:**
  - `src/lib/stripe.ts` — Stripe client singleton (null-safe when `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` missing)
  - `src/lib/billing-utils.ts` — `priceToPlan()`, `planToPrice()`, `VALID_CHECKOUT_PLANS`
  - `src/app/api/billing/status/route.ts` — `GET /api/billing/status` lifecycle data endpoint
- **Files Modified:**
  - `src/app/api/billing/checkout/route.ts` — Stripe customer lookup/create, 14-day trial logic, `allow_promotion_codes`, `ApiError` throughout, removed mock fallbacks, correct `cancel_url`
  - `src/app/api/billing/portal/route.ts` — replaced `NextResponse.json` with `ApiError`, uses singleton
  - `src/app/api/billing/webhook/route.ts` — uses imported singleton, wrapped `handleCheckoutCompleted` / `handleSubscriptionDeleted` / `handleInvoicePaymentFailed` in `db.transaction()`, added cancellation email to `handleSubscriptionDeleted`
  - `src/lib/env.ts` — Stripe env vars now warn loudly at startup if missing
  - `src/lib/api/errors.ts` — added `ApiError.serviceUnavailable()` (503)

**Decisions & Notes:**

- Trial logic: only offers 14-day Stripe trial on first-ever subscription (checks `subscriptions` table count).
- Plan enum stores `"agency"` only — `billing-utils.ts` maps both `agency_monthly` and `agency_annual` to the same tier.
- `pnpm lint && pnpm typecheck` — ✅ passes with zero errors.

---

## Phase 2 — Frontend Billing Experience

- **Status:** ✅ Complete (2026-03-25)
- **Files Created:**
  - `src/components/settings/billing-status.tsx` — live subscription lifecycle widget (status badge, trial countdown, next billing date, cancelAtPeriodEnd notice, past_due warning)
  - `src/components/settings/billing-success-poller.tsx` — invisible client component that polls `/api/billing/status` every 2 s for up to 30 s after checkout success, fires a success toast, refreshes the page, and clears the `?billing` query param
- **Files Modified:**
  - `src/app/dashboard/settings/page.tsx` — added `<BillingStatus />` and `<BillingSuccessPoller>` to subscription card; success notice now handled by poller toast instead of static text
  - `src/components/billing/pricing-card.tsx` — added `perMonthEquivalent` + `savingsPercent` to `PricingPlan` interface; rendered below the price on annual cards
  - `src/components/billing/pricing-table.tsx` — annual Pro (~$24/mo, save 17%) and Agency (~$83/mo, save 17%) plans now show per-month equivalent
  - `src/components/ui/trial-banner.tsx` — fixed `shouldShowForPlan` to show during Stripe trialing (plan is no longer "free"); added guard to hide when trial expired and user converted to paid

**Decisions & Notes:**

- Post-checkout success: Option A implemented (polling). `BillingSuccessPoller` runs immediately on mount, polls every 2 s, max 15 attempts (30 s). Fires toast as soon as plan changes from "free".
- `TrialBanner` now shows whenever `trialEndsAt` is set, regardless of current plan — fixes the case where Stripe sets plan to e.g. "pro_monthly" during trial. Hides when trial has expired and plan is paid (user converted).

---

## Phase 3 — Subscription Lifecycle Handling

- **Status:** ✅ Complete (2026-03-26)
- **Files Modified:**
  - `src/app/api/billing/webhook/route.ts` — extended `handleSubscriptionUpdated` with:
    - §3.1 Trial expiration: detects `incomplete_expired` Stripe status → downgrades user to free, sends email + notification
    - §3.2 Plan upgrades/downgrades: already handled by price ID → plan mapping (no change needed)
    - §3.3 Cancellation: detects `cancelAtPeriodEnd` flip `false→true` → sends cancellation-scheduled email + notification
    - §3.5 Reactivation: detects `cancelAtPeriodEnd` flip `true→false` → sends reactivation email + notification
  - `src/components/settings/billing-status.tsx` — fixed bug: `isCanceled` was checking `"canceled"` (American) but DB enum stores `"cancelled"` (British) — was causing the Canceled badge to never render

**Decisions & Notes:**

- `incomplete_expired` (no payment method added during trial, subscription never had a first invoice) is handled in `handleSubscriptionUpdated`, not `handleInvoicePaymentFailed`, because Stripe does not fire `invoice.payment_failed` in this path.
- `past_due` (first invoice attempted but failed) continues to be handled by `handleInvoicePaymentFailed` with a 7-day grace period. No double-handling.
- All `cancelAtPeriodEnd` flip detection compares existing DB record value vs new Stripe value — already pre-fetched by `getSubscriptionRecord()` before the UPDATE query.
- Verification required (manual Stripe portal config):
  - Configure cancellation to happen at period end (not immediate) in Stripe Customer Portal settings
  - Confirm plan switch via portal sends `customer.subscription.updated` (it does, by default)
  - Confirm reactivation via portal sends `customer.subscription.updated` with `cancel_at_period_end: false` (it does)

## Phase 4 — Hardening & Edge Cases

- **Status:** ✅ Complete (2026-03-26)
- **Files Created:**
  - `src/lib/billing-redis.ts` — lightweight IORedis singleton for billing-only caching (separate from BullMQ connection; short command timeout so Redis hiccups never block billing responses)
- **Files Modified:**
  - `src/app/api/billing/status/route.ts` — Phase 4.5 sync failsafe added: on cache miss (once/hr per user), fetches live Stripe subscription via `stripe.subscriptions.retrieve()`, detects status/plan/cancelAtPeriodEnd drift vs DB, reconciles `subscriptions` row and `user.plan` in a transaction, caches check key for 1 hour in Redis; non-fatal — falls through to DB data on any Stripe/Redis error

**Items Status:**

- ✅ 4.1 Webhook security — raw body (`req.text()`), `constructEvent()` with STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET, 400 on bad signature, 200 for unhandled events (already complete from Phase 1)
- ✅ 4.2 Idempotency — `processedWebhookEvents` table checked before processing; event ID inserted after success; duplicate retries return 200 immediately (already complete from Phase 1)
- ✅ 4.3 Race condition — `BillingSuccessPoller` polls `/api/billing/status` every 2s for up to 30s after redirect (already complete from Phase 2)
- ✅ 4.4 Env validation — `checkEnv()` in `env.ts` warns loudly at startup for all 6 missing Stripe vars; Stripe routes use null-safe guards (`if (!stripe)`) to allow running without billing in local dev — intentional design, not a gap
- ✅ 4.5 Sync failsafe — implemented (see above)
- ✅ 4.6 Stripe webhook events — required events documented below

**Stripe Webhook Events Required (register in Stripe Dashboard → Webhooks):**

```
checkout.session.completed
checkout.session.expired
customer.subscription.created
customer.subscription.updated
customer.subscription.deleted
customer.subscription.trial_will_end
invoice.payment_succeeded
invoice.payment_failed
```

Local dev: `stripe listen --forward-to localhost:3000/api/billing/webhook`

**Decisions & Notes:**

- Sync failsafe uses `stripe.subscriptions.retrieve(stripeSubscriptionId)` — targeted lookup via the stored subscription ID, not a `list()` scan, to minimise latency and API cost.
- Redis cache key: `billing:synced:{userId}`, TTL 3600 s. If Redis is unavailable, the sync runs on every request (non-ideal but safe — Stripe API calls are idempotent).
- In-memory mutation of `latestSub.status` / `latestSub.cancelAtPeriodEnd` after reconciliation avoids a redundant DB round-trip for the response.
